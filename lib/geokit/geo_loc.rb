module Geokit
  # This class encapsulates the result of a geocoding call.
  # It's primary purpose is to homogenize the results of multiple
  # geocoding providers. It also provides some additional functionality, such as
  # the "full address" method for geocoders that do not provide a
  # full address in their results (for example, Yahoo), and the "is_us" method.
  #
  # Some geocoders can return multple results. Geoloc can capture multiple
  # results through its "all" method.
  #
  # For the geocoder setting the results, it would look something like this:
  #     geo=GeoLoc.new(first_result)
  #     geo.all.push(second_result)
  #     geo.all.push(third_result)
  #
  # Then, for the user of the result:
  #
  #     puts geo.full_address     # just like usual
  #     puts geo.all.size  => 3   # there's three results total
  #     puts geo.all.first        # all is just an array or additional geolocs,
  #                                 so do what you want with it

    # 100 Spear St, San Francisco, CA, 94101, US

    # attribute if they don't exist
