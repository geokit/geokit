## DESCRIPTION

The Geokit gem provides:

 * Distance calculations between two points on the earth. Calculate the distance in miles, kilometers, meters, or nautical miles, with all the trigonometry abstracted away by Geokit.
 * Geocoding from multiple providers. It supports Google, Yahoo, Geocoder.us, and Geocoder.ca geocoders, and others. It provides a uniform response structure from all of them.
   It also provides a fail-over mechanism, in case your input fails to geocode in one service.
 * Rectangular bounds calculations: is a point within a given rectangular bounds?
 * Heading and midpoint calculations

Combine this gem with the [geokit-rails](http://github.com/geokit/geokit-rails) to get location-based finders for your Rails app.

## QUICK START

```ruby
    irb> require 'rubygems'
    irb> require 'geokit'
    irb> a=Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode '140 Market St, San Francisco, CA'
    irb> a.ll
     => 37.79363,-122.396116
    irb> b=Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode '789 Geary St, San Francisco, CA'
    irb> b.ll
     => 37.786217,-122.41619
    irb> a.distance_to(b)
     => 1.21120007413626
    irb> a.heading_to(b)
    => 244.959832435678
    irb(main):006:0> c=a.midpoint_to(b)      # what's halfway from a to b?
    irb> c.ll
    => "37.7899239257175,-122.406153503469"
    irb(main):008:0> d=c.endpoint(90,10)     # what's 10 miles to the east of c?
    irb> d.ll
    => "37.7897825005142,-122.223214776155"
```

FYI, that `.ll` method means "latitude longitude".

See the RDOC more more ... there are also operations on rectangular bounds (e.g., determining if a point is within bounds, find the center, etc).

## CONFIGURATION

If you're using this gem by itself, here are the configuration options:

### Google Geocoder Tricks

The Google Geocoder sports a number of useful tricks that elevate it a little bit above the rest of the currently supported geocoders. For starters, it returns a `suggested_bounds` property for all your geocoded results, so you can more easily decide where and how to center a map on the places you geocode. Here's a quick example:

```ruby
    irb> res = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode('140 Market St, San Francisco, CA')
    irb> pp res.suggested_bounds
    #<Geokit::Bounds:0x53b36c
     @ne=#<Geokit::LatLng:0x53b204 @lat=37.7968528, @lng=-122.3926933>,
     @sw=#<Geokit::LatLng:0x53b2b8 @lat=37.7905576, @lng=-122.3989885>>

In addition, you can use viewport or country code biasing to make sure the geocoders prefers results within a specific area. Say we wanted to geocode the city of Toledo in Spain. A normal geocoding query would look like this:

    irb> res = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode('Toledo')
    irb> res.full_address
    => "Toledo, OH, USA"
```

Not exactly what we were looking for. We know that Toledo is in Spain, so we can tell the Google Geocoder to prefer results from Spain first, and then wander the Toledos of the world. To do that, we have to pass Spain's ccTLD (country code top-level domain) to the `:bias` option of the `geocode` method. You can find a comprehensive list of all ccTLDs here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CcTLD.

```ruby
    irb> res = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode('Toledo', :bias => 'es')
    irb> res.full_address
    => "Toledo, Toledo, Spain"
```

Alternatively, we can specify the geocoding bias as a bounding box object. Say we wanted to geocode the Winnetka district in Los Angeles.

```ruby
    irb> res = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode('Winnetka')
    irb> res.full_address
    => "Winnetka, IL, USA"
```

Not it. What we can do is tell the geocoder to return results only from in and around LA.

```ruby
    irb> la_bounds = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode('Los Angeles').suggested_bounds
    irb> res = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode('Winnetka', :bias => la_bounds)
    irb> res.full_address
    => "Winnetka, California, USA"
```

Another option is to use Component Filtering as described at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#ComponentFiltering. To do that supply the `:components` option to the `geocode` method. This option should be a hash with keys corresponding to desired component names.

Suppose we'd like to geocode string 'Austin'. Regularly, Google would return 'Austin, TX, USA' for such a query. Not with component filtering:

```ruby
    irb>res = Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode("austin", components: { administrative_area: 'IL', country: 'US' })
    irb>res.full_address
    => "Austin, Chicago, IL, USA"
```

### The Multigeocoder
Multi Geocoder - provides failover for the physical location geocoders, and also IP address geocoders. Its configured by setting Geokit::Geocoders::provider_order, and Geokit::Geocoders::ip_provider_order. You should call the Multi-Geocoder with its :geocode method, supplying one address parameter which is either a real street address, or an ip address. For example:

```ruby
    Geokit::Geocoders::MultiGeocoder.geocode("900 Sycamore Drive")

    Geokit::Geocoders::MultiGeocoder.geocode("12.12.12.12")

    Geokit::Geocoders::MultiGeocoder.geocode("Hamburg, Germany", :provider_order => [:osm, :mapbox, :google])
```

## MULTIPLE RESULTS
Some geocoding services will return multple results if the there isn't one clear result.
Geoloc can capture multiple results through its "all" method.

```ruby
    irb> geo=Geokit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode("900 Sycamore Drive")
    irb> geo.full_address
    => "900 Sycamore Dr, Arkadelphia, AR 71923, USA"
    irb> geo.all.size
    irb> geo.all.each { |e| puts e.full_address }
    900 Sycamore Dr, Arkadelphia, AR 71923, USA
    900 Sycamore Dr, Burkburnett, TX 76354, USA
    900 Sycamore Dr, TN 38361, USA
    ....
```

geo.all is just an array of additional Geolocs, so do what you want with it. If you call .all on a
geoloc that doesn't have any additional results, you will get  an array of one.


## NOTES ON WHAT'S WHERE

mappable.rb contains the Mappable module, which provides basic
distance calculation methods, i.e., calculating the distance
between two points.

LatLng is a simple container for latitude and longitude, but
it's made more powerful by mixing in the above-mentioned Mappable
module -- therefore, you can calculate easily the distance between two
LatLng ojbects with `distance = first.distance_to(other)`

GeoLoc represents an address or location which
has been geocoded. You can get the city, zipcode, street address, etc.
from a GeoLoc object. GeoLoc extends LatLng, so you also get lat/lng
AND the Mappable module goodness for free.

geocoders.rb contains all the geocoder implemenations. All the gercoders
inherit from a common base (class Geocoder) and implement the private method
do_geocode.

## WRITING YOUR OWN GEOCODERS

If you would like to write your own geocoders, you can do so by requiring 'geokit' or 'geokit/geocoders.rb' in a new file and subclassing the base class (which is class "Geocoder").
You must then also require such external file back in your main geokit configuration.

```ruby
  require "geokit"

  module Geokit
    module Geocoders

      # and use :my to specify this geocoder in your list of geocoders.
      class MyGeocoder < Geocoder

        # Use via: Geokit::Geocoders::MyGeocoder.key = 'MY KEY'
        config :key

        private

        def self.do_geocode(address, options = {})
          # Main geocoding method
        end

        def self.parse_json(json)
          # Helper method to parse http response. See geokit/geocoders.rb.
        end
      end

    end
  end
```
